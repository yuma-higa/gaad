      <h2 class="card-title">thanks</h2>
      <p class="card-text">thank you for everything you did to me so far, expressing my feeling in Japanese is kinda embarrasing for me,
        so I dicided to write down my feeling in English instead of using Japanese.you can use your daughter as a translater or just use translater,
        I think you would better to use a translater than using your daughter,I guess she wouldn't understand any English words anymore since she is just a banana.
        anyway I appreciate everything you did for me, I'm now 25 years old and I understand people shold work at this age.so a lot of parents wouldn't allow their son
        to take education in abroad when their son asked it.but my dad was different from other parents. my dad doesn't only allow me to go to abroad but he was also 
        very cooperative. that meant a lot to me. thank you for everything dad, you are the best farther for me.
      </p>
